# Spring Boot Reference Application

The intention of the Reference Application is to serve as a guide when developing "Fagapplikasjoner" within
Skatteetaten; applications implementing the core business rules in the tax domain for which Skatteetaten is responsible.

In this repository your will find examples on how to solve common technical issues and implement requirements for 
applications running within the networks of Skatteetaten, like logging, handling database migrations, testing, 
security, application versioning, build pipeline, to name a few.

The Reference Application is implemented in Spring Boot, which is currently the recommended technology for all new
applications.
